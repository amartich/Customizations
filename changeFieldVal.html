<!--assuming you have this date stored in a database extension of off 
    the users table (maybe called U_users_training.trainingdate),
     and you are displaying the value in this field on a custom page in the admin or teacher portal -
      a page where you had access to the users dcid, you could do something like this:-->

<style>
.red {
color:red;
}
</style>

~[tlist_sql;
select 
case 
when round(floor(months_between(sysdate, trainingdate)) /12) > 3 then 'red'
else 'regular'
end as color
, trainingdate 
from U_users_training
where U_users_training.usersdcid = ~(rn)]

<span class = "~(color)">Date of training is ~(trainingdate)</span>

[/tlist_sql]
