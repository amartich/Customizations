Anyel, the issue was that the <span> itself has no value, but the original code was looking at the value of the <span>. To further compound the problem, the single equals makes the JavaScript set the value to 1, instead of just checking "if" it is 1. As a result, the "if" just looks to see if setting the value to 1 is successful, and it virtually always is, so it runs the code inside. 
I know you've since found a non-JavaScript answer but I'd already written this up by the time I saw that, and maybe it'd be helpful for understanding in case you later need JavaScript to do a similar task down the road.-->

<script>
    $j(document).ready(function(){
        // Let's check the database value instead of the value of the item on the page
        if ('~([Students.U_Students_Extension]IB_MASTER_STATUS)' === '1') {
            // Locates the ID of IBDP (your span) and sets the CSS
            $j('#IBDP').css( { color: 'red', background: 'yellow' } );
        } else {
            // Pick one of these for when it's not 1... If you want it off the page completely, you can use this
            $j('#IBDP').remove();
            // Or if you still want it in the DOM but not showing to the user, you can do this
            $j('#IBDP').hide();
            // Or if you want to do what you were doing with white on white, you can do this:
            $j('#IBDP').css( { color: 'white', background: 'white' } );
        }
    });
</script>

<!--While we don't have to use jQuery to do these things, PowerSchool already loads it whether you use it or not. 
It does somewhat simplify the code for what you wanted to do. You can keep using the plain JavaScript if you prefer. 
The main piece to take home is the "if" piece, and knowing what you're comparing. 
The triple equals requires the data type of both items to be the same, and since I wrap both the database value and the value 
we're looking for (1) in single quotes, they are both strings. I read somewhere a long time ago that triple equals is faster than
double equals (even if ever so slightly), so that's just how I do it. :-)
Lastly, sorry to derail the thread a little bit here, but I noticed in Joe's example that there is a header for DCID but 
the value is ~([01]id). These fields are not the same thing, and people often get burned assuming they are. 
Sometimes they happen to be the same (particularly on older records), but they are most often different in my experience. 
If you want to reliably get the DCID there, I would recommend using ~(studentrn) instead of ~([01]id). ~(studentrn) is the record number (DCID) 
for the selected student and ~([01]id) is the internal student ID, which is also the ID you find when you go to Teacher Comments.

Hope this helps!
